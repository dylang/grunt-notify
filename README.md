## Getting Started

This plugin recommends Grunt `0.4.1` or newer.

## Installing

```bash
npm install grunt-notify --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's `Gruntfile.js`:

```js
// Automatic notifications when tasks fail.
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-notify');
```

Make sure the application directory of Growl/Snarl is on your system `path`. For Snarl this has to be the `tools` folder, where `heysnarl.exe` is located.

**That's all you need for automatic notifications.**

## Notify_Hooks Options

If you want change the automatic messaging configure a task called `notify_hooks`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
 // This is optional!
  notify_hooks: {
    options: {
      enabled: true,
      max_jshint_notifications: 5, // maximum number of notifications from jshint output
      title: "Project Name" // defaults to the name in package.json, or uses project's directory name, you can change to the name of your project
    }
  }
});

// Load the task
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-notify');

// This is required if you use any options.
grunt.task.run('notify_hooks');
```

## Showing Specfic Notifications

Sometimes you want to show messages like "Uglify complete" or "Project Deployed" - that's easy to do too.

[![Notification Center: Custom Text](screenshots/notification-center-deploy.png)](https://github.com/dylang/grunt-notify)

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  notify: {
    task_name: {
      options: {
        // Task-specific options go here.
      }
    },
    watch: {
      options: {
        title: 'Task Complete',  // optional
        message: 'SASS and Uglify finished running', //required
      }
    },
    server: {
      options: {
        message: 'Server is ready!'
      }
    }
  }
});

grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-notify');

// simplified example
grunt.registerTask('server', [
  'uglify',
  'sass',
  'server',
  'notify:server'
  ]);
```

### Options
* `title` (_optional_): Notification title
* `message` (_required_): Notification message

## Tests
Run `grunt` to lint and run the tests.

## Terminal Notifier
Apple does not provide an API to the OS X Notification Center that Node can access. Only code written in Objective C and signed in XCode can use it.
This is not very friendly for Node users so we are using the tiny signed MIT-licensed native application
[Terminal Notifer](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) from [Eloy Dur√°n](https://github.com/alloy).
I've changed the default icon which is owned by Apple to the Grunt logo.

## Doodle or Die
This project was created for and is used by the free game I co-created for Node Knockout called [Doodle or Die](http://doodleOrDie.com). Please give it a try, we think you will enjoy it!
